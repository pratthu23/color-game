🎨 Colored Square Game
A simple terminal-based guessing game written in C++. The program randomly selects a color, and the player must guess it from a list of predefined options.

🕹️ Gameplay
The game randomly chooses one of five colors:

Red

Green

Blue

Yellow

Purple

Your task is to guess which color the game has chosen. The game continues in a loop until you guess the correct color.

📋 Features
Random color selection using rand()

Case-insensitive user input

Basic input validation

Console screen clearing with system("cls") (Windows only)

Pause between guesses with Sleep(1000) (1 second delay)

🧱 Requirements
Windows OS (uses windows.h and system("cls"))

C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, MSVC)

🚀 How to Run
Compile the code
Open Command Prompt and compile the file with your C++ compiler:
g++ -o ColorGame ColorGame.cpp

Run the game
./ColorGame

3.Guess the color!

🛠️ Notes
This game is case-insensitive. You can type colors in any case (e.g., Red, rEd, RED).

The screen clears after each guess for a cleaner interface.

Works on Windows only due to windows.h and system("cls").

Sample Output
